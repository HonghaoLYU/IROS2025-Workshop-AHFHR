<h3>Content of the workshop and expected impact:</h3>

<h4>Objectives of the Workshop:</h4>
<p>The objective of this workshop is to explore and promote the integration of advanced haptic technologies in healthcare robotics, focusing on enhancing rehabilitation, assistive devices, and patient care. The workshop aims to showcase cutting-edge innovations in haptic feedback systems, emphasizing their applications in robotic rehabilitation platforms and assistive solutions for individuals with disabilities or mobility challenges. By fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration between robotics researchers, healthcare professionals, and engineers, the event will address key challenges in the design and implementation of haptic systems, such as real-time feedback, sensor accuracy, and user-centered development. It will also examine the ethical, regulatory, and societal implications of deploying haptic-enabled healthcare robots, discussing issues like privacy, autonomy, and equity. Lastly, the workshop will provide a platform for future research and innovation, advancing the role of haptic technologies in healthcare and catalyzing growth in this field.</p>

<h4>Ensure the Highest Quality:</h4>
<p>This workshop aims to introduce the emerging research area of haptic technologies for healthcare robotic applications, a topic not fully addressed by most robotics conferences. The workshop will engage attendees through invited talks, panel discussions, live demonstrations, and poster sessions showcasing cutting-edge research. Interactive breakout sessions and networking opportunities will foster collaboration, brainstorming, and idea exchange, ensuring active participation and meaningful discussions to advance haptic technologies for healthcare robotics. Without such a workshop, researchers and practitioners may struggle to find a platform for in-depth discussions and dissemination of their work specifically focused on haptic techniques for healthcare. Additionally, this workshop will serve as a catalyst for future events and collaborations in this growing field. By hosting this workshop, IROS can further cement its leadership position in a rapidly evolving area of research that is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Thus, a dedicated workshop on this topic is both timely and essential.</p>

<h3>Intended audience and expected attendance:</h3>
<p>The intended audience for this workshop includes researchers, engineers, healthcare professionals, and industry experts interested in haptic technologies and their applications in healthcare robotics. Attendees are expected to have backgrounds in robotics, biomedical engineering, haptics, human-robot interaction, or healthcare technology development. The workshop will specifically target members of relevant IEEE RAS Technical Committees (TCs), including:</p>
